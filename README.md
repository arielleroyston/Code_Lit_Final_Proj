# Project Proposal
Wouldn't it be fun if you could play music in mid-air? And then a screen could capture a beautiful image based on the sound you play? That was my initial idea for my Code Literacy final. I wanted to build a way for people to abstractly play music and create visual art while they did that.

To do this, I drew inspiration from XX's Webcam Piano. However, isntead of using OSC (an oscillator that sends code off to a keyboard), I would be building all of the music interpretations in my application. I would need to think through how a touch gesture would kick off a sound, and how to integrate sounds into an applicaion. I will be using P5 Processing software for this, and subsequently will be leveraging the p5 DOM, Flow, and Sound Libraries to make my idea come to ife.

#Process
I began my project through thinking throug the different aspects of the piano that I wanted to create. I decided to break up my end product into several pieces: 1) a touch sensor that would pick up finger movements through the camera; 2) sound cues from touch; and 3) introducing visuals for each sound / touch combination.
